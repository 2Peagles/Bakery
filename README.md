This is the first site I built by myself a couple of months ago with Tacyhons. So now I've come back to it to make it better and honestly I just think i'm going to do custom css, it's just easier for me. I'm taking out the about section and putting it in the home page. Giving the product page more width on the sides and that's about it. I put togther a figma design for this recently and I'm glad i'm re-doing this project! 
I decided to change the navbar as well since I was here and creat my own icon, so I think I should be finished by tommrow.
